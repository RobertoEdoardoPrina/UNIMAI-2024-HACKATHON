# Customer Churn Prediction Solution

## Project Overview

This project addresses the challenge faced by a large multinational company that provides B2B products and services. The company is experiencing declining client numbers and lacks a structured, data-driven approach to monitor small customers who are at risk of churning. The goal of this project is to develop a solution that identifies early warning signs of customer churn, allowing the company to act proactively and prevent potential revenue loss.

## Problem Statement

The company struggles with managing vast, inconsistent, and non-real-time data across multiple ERP systems. While large customers are closely monitored, the smaller but more numerous customer segment lacks detailed analysis, which impacts the company's overall financial health. Current monitoring is subjective, lacking a systematic approach to highlight potential churn risks and optimize customer interactions.

## Proposed Solution

The solution is a sandbox environment that integrates data from various sources and employs AI-driven analytics to predict customer churn. This approach combines internal data analysis with external market insights to provide actionable intelligence for the company's sales and customer support teams.

### Key Features

1. **Data Integration**: Aggregates data from multiple ERP systems, including customer master data, orders, inventory, and performance metrics. The solution addresses inconsistencies and ensures data is processed into a unified format suitable for analysis.

2. **Churn Prediction Model**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze historical data, identify patterns, and predict which customers are at risk of churning. It generates a risk score for each customer, highlighting those needing immediate attention.

3. **Actionable Insights**: Provides sales and customer support teams with insights into the needs of at-risk customers and the strengths of competitors, enabling targeted interventions to retain clients.

4. **Real-Time Alerts**: Generates real-time alerts for customers whose risk score falls below a predefined threshold, prompting timely action to address potential issues before they result in churn.

5. **Market and Competitor Analysis**: Incorporates external data, including market trends and competitor analysis, to enhance the decision-making process with a broader context of the competitive landscape.

## Solution Architecture

The solution is structured around a multi-step approach:

1. **Data Retrieval**: Data is collected from various ERP systems and external sources, ensuring a comprehensive view of customer interactions and market conditions.

2. **Scoring and Analysis**: Internal scores are calculated based on historical data and similarity metrics. An NLP algorithm further refines these scores by analyzing sentiment and feedback.

3. **Integration of External Insights**: PESTEL and SWOT analyses are conducted to understand the market and competitive environment, informing targeted sales actions.

4. **Action Plan Deployment**: The insights and scores are used to guide sales strategies, helping teams prioritize their efforts based on customer needs and risk levels.

## Project Timeline

- **Month 1**: Data retrieval from ERP systems, initial score calculation, and supply chain analysis.
- **Month 2**: Internal similarity scoring, customer risk score calculation, and NLP model creation.
- **Month 3**: External market analysis, deployment of sales action plans, and system refinement.
